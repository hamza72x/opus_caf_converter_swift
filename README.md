# Opus to CAF Converter

This repository provides a Swift script with a function called `convertOpusToCaf` that converts an Opus file to a Core Audio Format (CAF) file. The Opus codec is designed for high-quality, low-latency audio compression, while the Core Audio Format is a container format developed by Apple for use with their Core Audio framework.

The purpose of this script is to provide a simple and efficient way to convert Opus files to CAF files, which can be useful in applications that require compatibility with Apple's Core Audio framework or other platforms that support CAF files.

## Usage

The `convertOpusToCaf` function accepts two arguments:

- `inputFile` (String): The input file path of the Opus file to be converted.
- `outputPath` (String): The output file path where the converted CAF file will be saved.

Example usage:

```swift
convertOpusToCaf(inputFile: "input.opus", outputPath: "output.caf")
```

The function will read the Opus file at the specified input path, perform the conversion, and save the resulting CAF file at the specified output path.

## Implementation Details

The `convertOpusToCaf` function performs the following steps:

1. Opens the input Opus file and initializes the Opus decoder.
2. Loops through the Opus file, parsing each page and extracting audio data and frame sizes.
3. Constructs a new CAF file with the appropriate headers, chunks, and audio data.
4. Writes the CAF file to the specified output file path.

Please note that the provided script only supports mono and stereo audio channels. If you need to work with other channel configurations, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.

## Dependencies

The script uses the `Foundation` framework, which is part of the Swift Standard Library and provides fundamental building blocks for Swift apps. No external dependencies are required.

## Running the Script

To run the script, you can create a Swift file and include the code provided in the example. Make sure to adjust the `inputFile` and `outputPath` values according to your specific use case. Then, you can run the Swift file using the Swift compiler or a Swift REPL.

```swift
import Foundation

// Add the `convertOpusToCaf` function and other necessary code here

// Example usage
let inputFile = "input.opus"
let outputPath = "output.caf"
convertOpusToCaf(inputFile: inputFile, outputPath: outputPath)
```
